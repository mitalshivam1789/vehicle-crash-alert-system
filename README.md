# vehicle-crash-alert-system
In our project we are making an vehicle crash alert system by using NodeMCU microcontroller, MPU6050 sensor, Bluetooth, and GPS sensor.
We are using MPU6050 to detect the accident in bikes and we use abs system of cars to detect the accident.
We connect our system with the help of bluetooth by our phone. We made an App to send the details of the user to our system.
Using GPS we detect the location where accident will occur.
When ever accident will occur the system will send the location of the vehicle along with the details of the user like name and numbers of the user.
